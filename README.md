# JoyconGlue
A C# vJoy feeder using SharpJoycon

# Placeholder
Will fill this with code tomorrow. 
I'm splitting this project into 2 parts:
* SharpJoycon: A cross-platform library to utilize the Joycons (and theoretically other Switch controllers)
* JoyconGlue: A vJoy feeder, only able to run on Windows
